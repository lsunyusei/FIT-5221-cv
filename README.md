The goal of the system is to output a set of images which are engaging and provide an affective summary of
the event.
The input to the system is a video and the system outputs important frames from the event,
which summarize the key happenings of the event. For eg: if an input video is that of a birthday
party, key summary points can be image with cake cut, smiling people etc. 

The function generateCoolSummary() takes into input the relative address of frames (from a
short duration video) and returns the following two
a. Collage of important frames chosen by your method. Now instead of the collage having
images placed in rigid grids (like in Assignment 1) merge the boundary areas of images
to make the collage look more seamless.
b. Convert the important frames into a GIF
